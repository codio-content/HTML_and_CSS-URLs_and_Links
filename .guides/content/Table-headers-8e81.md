Now let's add a header to our table :

<table>
<tr> 
    <th> Col 1 </th> 
    <th> Col 2 </th> 
</tr>
<tr> 
    <td> Entry 1.1 </td> 
    <td> Entry 1.2 </td> 
</tr>
<tr> 
    <td> Entry 2.1 </td> 
    <td> Entry 2.2 </td> 
</tr>
</table>

In order to do that we have added the following code  before our first tr in the previous code :

```html
<tr> 
    <th> Col 1 </th> 
    <th> Col 2 </th> 
</tr>
```

`<th>` stands for <u>t</u>able <u>h</u>eader

We will see more about tables in future units. Let's start the final section of this unit.
