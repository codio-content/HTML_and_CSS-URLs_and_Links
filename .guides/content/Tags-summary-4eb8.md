As a reminder, here is a table of all the tags we saw in this chapter.

| `<a>` and `</a>` | A `<a>` represents a link to another resource on the web, it will cause your browser to navigate to the resources if he can understand it or download it otherwise, so you can open it on your computer. The attribute `href` of the link allow us to give the address of the targetted resource.   |

That's it for this Unit!
