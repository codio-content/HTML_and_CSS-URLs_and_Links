Let's introduce some new html tags for lists and tables.

# Ordered and unordered lists

Here is a simple list we would like to reproduce :

<iframe width="100%" src="/lists/ex1.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen id="iframe_ex_1" onLoad="autoResize('iframe_ex_1');"></iframe>

How do we do it ?

The tag to start an unordered list is `<ul>` (as in <u>u</u>nordered <u>l</u>ist).

If you just use the tags `<ul> </ul>` We are opening a new list and then closing it. But there is nothing inside it.

In order to add items to the list, we need to use the `<li>` tag (as in <u>l</u>ist <u>i</u>tem)

So every entry of the list must be wrapped in `<li>` and the whole thing must be wrapped in a `<ul>`

Now let's see ordered list. Basically they are almost the same as unordered lists.

The only difference being you use `<ol> </ol>` around your `<li>`'s and your list will be numbered !

Here is an example :

<iframe width="100%" src="/lists/ex2.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen id="iframe_ex_3" onLoad="autoResize('iframe_ex_3');"></iframe>
