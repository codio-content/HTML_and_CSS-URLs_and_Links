Now that we have mastered pages, links, urls and paths, let's do a more complex challenge :

|||challenge

We will create a navigation menu for our website.

This website consists of 3 pages:
1. The home page (index.html)
2. The about page (about.html)
3. The contact page (contact.html)

In the treeview on the left, there is a folder called "nav", we have already created all the pages for you.

Here is the folder structure of the website :

![](.guides/img/nav_structure.png)

The challenges consists of having all the links in the nav section working and leading to the correct page. Open all the files : `index.html` `contact.html` and `about.html`

Notice that there are no urls in the `href` of all `<a>` that are in the navigation at the end of the body of each. 

Each link should go to the correct page. So please write the correct urls for each of those. Don't forget that about and contact are in a different folder than index and please use relative path, no absolute paths here !

You can also change the "XXXX" in the about and index pages to your real first name if you want!
