# Recap

In the first unit we covered the basics of HTML, the general structure of an HTML document, some basic text formatting, line breaks and spaces and finally images.

# In this unit

In this unit we will continue learning HTML covering links, URLs, references and how to navigate between pages. These concepts are very important because they shape what the web is. Without links and addresses, all the HTML pages out there would simply be disconnected and detached documents like text documents on your computer.
Then we will use some lists and tables to structure our informations. Finally we will look at some examples and challenges that use everything you have learnt so far.

So, let's start !
