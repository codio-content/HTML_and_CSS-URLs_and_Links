# In the previous unit

In the first unit we have seen the basics of html, the general structure of an html document, some basic text formatting, line breaks and spaces and finally images.

# In this unit

In this unit we will continue learning html and we will see links, urls, references and how to navigate between pages. These concepts are very important because they shape what is the web. Without links and addresses, all these html pages out there would simply be disconnected and detached documents like word documents are, for instance.
Then we will use some lists and tables to structure our informations. Finally we will mix links, images and structures all in one.

So, let's start !
