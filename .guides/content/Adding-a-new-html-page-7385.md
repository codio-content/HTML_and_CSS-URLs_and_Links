# A second page
Let's start by creating a second html page. 

For that, let's right click on `01-adding-html-page` folder in the treeview on the left, then a dropdown menu will appear, click on "New file ..." 

A popup window will appear, then use `page2.html` as the filename, you will notice that Codio detects that you want to create an html file and offers you to create from the html template, let's change it to "html5" then create it.

| Step 1  | Step 2  |

Once this is done, you can type anything in the html file. Just add at least a `h1` heading with "Page 2" as the content, so we can recognize that we are in this page, later when we'll use it.

Now under the directory `01-adding-html-page` you should have two html files. `index.html` and `page2.html`. If it's the case, head to [next](#) section.
