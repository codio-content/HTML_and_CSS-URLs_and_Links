There are 2 ways of describing where a ressources is on the web, and it depends if the resource your are trying to access is located on the same domain as the page in which it is used.

# URL
Before continuing, let's analyse an url. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a way of writing the "address" of a ressource on the internet.

Let's take an simple example : "http://www.codio.com" and describe the different parts of it 

**http** -> This is the protocol to communicate. HTTP stands for "Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol" as we know Hyper-Text is what webpages are made of, so basically for webpages, the protocol will almost always be http or https (https being the secure version of http)

**://** -> This is a convention and is a seperator between the protocol used and the rest of the url.

**www** -> Stands for world wide web and generally it's used so that people know that at this address there will be a webpage.

**codio** -> codio is the domain in itself.

**com**  -> .com is what is called the Top Level Domain or TLD. It is the last part of the domain name and is either giving indication on the type of domain (com is for commerce, org for organisation, ..) It can also be indicating a specific country : uk for United Kingdom, fr for France, ...)
