Can you tell the difference between `<img src="/images/2.jpg">` &nbsp; and &nbsp; `<img src="images/2.jpg">` ?

The only difference is that the first forward slash `/` is missing in the second case. What difference does it make?

The first one which begins with a `/` is called an <u>absolute path</u>, the second one is called a <u>relative path</u>.

To understand the difference between those two, let's add a folder called "somefolder" in our "somesite" folder.
