Here is a folder structure :

<img src=".guides/img/http_mysite_come.png">

Imagine, it's hosted on the url : [http://mysite.com]()

Let's imagine that in page1.html we have a `<a href="content/index.html">` What would be the full url ?

In this case it would be :

`http://mysite.com` + `content/index.html`

So `http://mysite.com/content/index.html`
