As a reminder, here is a table of all the tags we saw in this chapter.

| tag(s) | description |
| :-: | :---------: |
| `<html>` and `</html>` | These should be the first and last tags of every html document. |
| `<head>` and `</head>` | These is the 'invisible' part of an html document and just contains links and informations. |
| `<body>` and `</body>` | This is the 'visible' part of and html document and where the real content is|
| `<p>` and `</p>` | These represents a paragraph of text |
| `<b>` and `</b>` | The text inside these will be **bold**. |
| `<i>` and `</i>` | The text inside these will be *italic*. |
| `<u>` and `</u>` | The text inside these will be <u>underlined</u>. |
| `<br>` or `<br/>` | This indicates the browser that we wants a new line at that position (this tag doesn't require a end tag) |
| `<img>` or `<img/>` | This let us insert and image into the page (this tag doesn't require a end tag)|

That's it for this Unit!
